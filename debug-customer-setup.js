console.log('\n1. Plugin Configuration (payload.config.ts):')
console.log(`   automationPlugin({
     collections: ['orders', 'users', 'products'], // <- Must include 'orders'
     // ... other config
   })`)

console.log('\n2. Database Query (run this in your environment):')
console.log(`   const workflows = await payload.find({
     collection: 'workflows',
     depth: 2
   })
   console.log('Found workflows:', workflows.docs.length)
   console.log('Workflow details:', JSON.stringify(workflows.docs, null, 2))`)

console.log('\n3. Hook Registration Check:')
console.log(`   const orderCollection = payload.collections.orders
   console.log('afterChange hooks:', orderCollection.config.hooks?.afterChange?.length)`)

console.log('\n4. Manual Hook Trigger Test:')
console.log(`   // Manually call the executor method
   const executor = // get executor instance somehow
   await executor.executeTriggeredWorkflows('orders', 'update', updatedDoc, previousDoc, req)`)

console.log('\n5. Most Likely Issues:')
console.log('   - Plugin not configured with "orders" in collections array')
console.log('   - Workflow is in draft status (not published)')
console.log('   - Database connection issue (different DB in dev vs prod)')
console.log('   - PayloadCMS version compatibility issue')
console.log('   - Hook execution order (automation hook not running last)')

console.log('\nüí° Quick Test - Add this to your order update code:')
console.log(`   console.log('üîç DEBUG: About to update order')
   const result = await payload.update({ ... })
   console.log('üîç DEBUG: Order updated, hooks should have fired')
   
   // Check immediately after
   const runs = await payload.find({ collection: 'workflow-runs' })
   console.log('üîç DEBUG: Workflow runs after update:', runs.docs.length)`)
